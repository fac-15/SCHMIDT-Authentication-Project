+ [ ] Username is visible on each page of the site after logging in
+ [ ] Any user-submitted content should be labelled with the authors username
+ [ ] There should be protected routes and unprotected routes that depend on the user having a cookie or not (or what level of access they have).
+ [ ] Website content should be stored in a database
